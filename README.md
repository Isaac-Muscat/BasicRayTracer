# Basic Ray Tracer

Looking at Physically Based Rendering, Real Time Rendering, and the Raytracing in One Weekend series, this is a small raytracer as a first prototype in C++. I am hoping to create another one with glossy BRDFs and dielectric materials in the future. Note, the image is rendered on the CPU to an array and then the image is loaded to a texture and rendered on an OpenGL quad to view the results as it is being rendered to disk.
